				<h1>Hello World</h1>
				<p>My partner is Kiki, they are a really cool and geniune person and have good sense of humor. I'm glad that we were able to figure out the beginings of coding together. They live in a really cool house that has a trampoline in the backyard. I am Marissa, I have a dog named Cocoa Puff and a cat named Rei. I am a fine arts major and I am about to graduate in spring.
