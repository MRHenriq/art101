					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>My name is Marissa and I am from Davis, CA. I have a dog named cocoa puff, he is a good boy, and misses me when I go to class. I am a fine arts major and am graduating this spring. I have lots of interests and enjoy exploring many different art mediums. Some of my hobbies and interests include cooking, mixology, baking, hiking, gardening, yoga, alternative fashion, and thrifing. I hope to go to grad school for art one day, hopefully focusing on sustainable fashion or maybe something else. I would really like to learn how to make jewlery, I think it would be cool to be a silver or goldsmith, although right now I am learnig to make larger bronze sculptures through lost wax casting in the UCSC foundry. I feel really lucky to take this class becuase UCSC's foundry is the last one that is currently operational throughout the UC system. </p>
