			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab I made a sorting hat function that sorted a person in to different houses associated with musical genres.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I felt confident at first and definitle had an easier time with this lab but at first I had made a mistake in my code and the results were not appearing - realized I had put a colon in one line instead of semicolon and was able to find the error very quickly this time.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I'm more and more surprised at how I'm moving through the assignments more quickly and with less errors overall.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					
					<div class="input-output">
