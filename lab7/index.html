					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I had a hard time at the begining of this lab, some of my code to show my script output and my image were not working, but I was able to figure it out.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I realized that I had an extra div in my code for the script output and was able to fix that. Also, my code for the image src had an exta letter and I was able to fix that mistake as well.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here is the program I executed:</p>
