			<h1>Lab X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab challenged me to think sequentially. It made me think about the steps within steps and how to organize tasks accordingly. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first I was confused if I was supposed to actually start generating code, but once I understood this assignment was meant to teach me the planning before coding through the use of comments I was able to move forward relatively easily. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I tried to think of an example with many steps and substeps so I could practice slightly more complex task stacking and think about the details it would take to program something with many elements. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<h3>Task 1: Pseudocode an everyday task - Making a ginger bug: Free bubbly ginger soda!</h3>

				
				<ol>Sterilize a large glass jar with boiling water
					<li>Let cool</li></ol>
				<ol>Add ingredients
					<li>Grate ¼ cup of ginger with the skin on </li>
					<li>Add ginger and ¼ cup of sugar and the ginger to the jar</li>
					<li>Add 2 cups of water and stir</li></ol>
				<ol>Store and feed the ginger bug
					<li>Cover jar with a paper towel and a rubber band</li>
					<li>Put in fridge</li>
					<li>Wait 24 hrs and add 1tsp sugar, stir</li>
					<li>Wait 4-6 days and add more sugar, stir</li></ol>
				<ol>Using the ginger bug
					<li>When the bug forms bubbles, pour, or strain the ginger bug liquid into a glass and add water and simple syrup or agave as desired to taste, and enjoy!</li></ol>
				<ol>Maintaining the ginger bug
					<li>Add and stir in more ginger, sugar, and water back to the jar after use to keep the ginger bug alive!</li></ol>
				<ol>Alternative methods
					<li>The method above can be substituted with fresh turmeric intead of ginger</li>
					<li>You can also make wild fermented sodas with juniper berries, spruce tips, and white pine needles!</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Task 2: Pseudocode a simple computer game - Hangman </h3>
				
				<ol>Print the blank game board before each turn
				<ol> is initiated with a START button</ol>
					<li>Randomly generate a hidden word from an index of hidden words</li>
					<li>Generate a letter bank for user input</li>
					<li>Prompt user to pick a letter</li></ol>
				<ol>Accept user input
					<li>Validate user guess</li>
					<li>Reject letter guess if incorrect or accept user input if correct</li>
					<li>Cross letter off in word bank</li>
					<li>Generate letters for the correct corresponding user input</li></ol>
				<ol>Evaluate remaining letters
					<li>Prompt user input until all blanks are filled</li>
					<li>Repeat steps for accepting user input</li></ol>
				<ol>Once user fills all blanks accept user win
					<li>Initiate hangman animation </li></ol>
					<li>Clear letterbank and highlight final word</li>
				<ol>Generate game refresh button when user win is validated
					<li>Clear gameplay and print blank game board</li>
					<li>Remove previous gameplay words once completed</li>
					<li>Refresh hidden wordbank on page refresh</li></ol>
				</ul>
