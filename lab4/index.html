			<h1>Lab X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab challenged me to think sequentially. It made me think about the steps within steps and how to organize tasks accordingly. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first I was confused if I was supposed to actually start generating code, but once I understood this assignment was meant to teach me the planning before coding through the use of comments I was able to move forward relatively easily. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I tried to think of an example with many steps and substeps so I could practice slightly more complex task stacking and think about the details it would take to program something with many elements. </p>

				 <h3>Task 1: Pseudocode an everyday task - Making a ginger bug: Free bubbly ginger soda!</h3>

				<p>
				Sterilize a large glass jar with boiling water
					Let cool
				Add ingredients
					Grate ¼ cup of ginger with the skin on 
					Add ginger and ¼ cup of sugar and the ginger to the jar
					Add 2 cups of water and stir
				Store and feed the ginger bug
					Cover jar with a paper towel and a rubber band
					Put in fridge
					Wait 24 hrs and add 1tsp sugar, stir
					Wait 4-6 days and add more sugar, stir
				Using the ginger bug
					When the bug forms bubbles, pour, or strain the ginger bug liquid into a glass and add water and simple syrup or agave as desired to taste, and enjoy!
				Maintaining the ginger bug
					Add and stir in more ginger, sugar, and water back to the jar after use to keep the ginger bug alive! 
				Alternative methods
					The method above can be substituted with fresh turmeric intead of ginger
					You can also make wild fermented sodas with juniper berries, spruce tips, and white pine needles!

				<h4>Task 2: Pseudocode a simple computer game - Hangman </h4>
				
				<p>
				Print the blank game board before each turn
				Gameplay is initiated with a START button
				Randomly generate a hidden word from an index of hidden words
				Generate a letter bank for user input
				Prompt user to pick a letter 
				Accept user input
				Validate user guess
				Reject letter guess if incorrect or accept user input if correct
				Cross letter off in word bank
				Generate letters for the correct corresponding user input
				Evaluate remaining letters
				Prompt user input until all blanks are filled
				Repeat steps for accepting user input
				Once user fills all blanks accept user win
				Initiate hangman animation 
				Clear letterbank and highlight final word
				Generate game refresh button when user win is validated
				Clear gameplay and print blank game board
				Remove previous gameplay words once completed
				Refresh hidden wordbank on page refresh
				</p>
