			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab was meant to be used as an opportunity to complete debugging for any previous labs but since I am finishing the class in an incomplete, this doesnt really apply since I have been debugging as I go through each lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didnt really have any problems since I dont need to do any debugging. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I was able to debug as I completed each lab so I didnt really need to do any debugging here. </p>
